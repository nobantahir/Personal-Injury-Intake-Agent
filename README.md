2.  **Structured Data Extraction:**  Parses free-text responses into structured data points
    
3.  **Case Disqualification Analysis:**  Evaluates if cases meet disqualifying criteria
    
4.  **Case Priority Assessment:**  Analyzes case factors to determine priority and estimated value
    
5.  **Communication Generation:**  Creates appropriate qualification or disqualification messages

### Technical Architecture

-   **Frontend:**  Streamlit for user interface
-   **AI Integration:**  OpenAI API with GPT-4.1
-   **Session Management:**  Streamlit session state for conversation tracking
-   **Data Security:**  Local data processing with API key protection
